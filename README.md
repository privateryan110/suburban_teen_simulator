# suburban_teen_simulator
(this is a work in progress) 

You are a suburban teen stuck at home trying to hide your nefarious activities from your mother.

You are a teenager in a typical suburban home, doing activities that a lot of teenagers do. Only you have been caught by your mother and are grounded and stuck inside for a week. 
It is up to you to figure out how to continue said activities under the watchful eye of your parents for this period. 

Ideally this game would function very similarly to Dungeons and Dragons--different things in the game (the player character, the mother character, different items found around the house etc) would have statistics that would be modified by different events.
These statistics affect the probability of certain things happening. For instance, one of your activities would create smell in one of the rooms. If the mother character is in that room before the smell disippates, it would add to her suspicion level. 
If here suspicion level gets above a certin threshold, it triggers her searching of your room, if there are any incriminating items in your room, she catches you and you lose the game.

How to play:

  Controls:
    -You move your character around using WASD and your hand follows the cursor around the screen. 
    -Grab items by clicking with your character's hand (grabbable items will have a box appear around them when you put your curser over them)
    -You can put items in your inventory by dragging them over your character and placing them in the grid that will appear.
    -Open your inventory by pressing "i" or clicking on your character
    -Craft items by dragging them on top of each other (this will create a new item if the combination is craftable)
    -Use items by holding SHIFT (some take a few seconds and may need to be held by your character's mouth to trigger their use

  Time:
    Time passes at the top right corner of the screen (shown by the clock).

  High level:
    Your level of high is displayed by the green bar at the bottom of the screen. Try to keep it from emptying out. 

  Crafting:
    You can craft items by placing items over each other. If the combination of items creates something else, a new item, with different properties will appear. 

  Items:
    Different items have different properties. If they can be used, hold SHIFT to do so.

  Gameplay:
    You can move around the house as you please, and up to the second story through the stairs at the top of the map. 

SAMPLE GAMEPLAY:

  Here is a good demo of the mechanics in this game: 
    1) Collect the apple on the coffee table and place it in your inventory.
    2) Go over to the kitchen counter and grab the knife.
    3) Take the apple out of your inventory and hold it on top of the knife. This creates a third item: an apple with a hole in it.
    4) Now take this item and go upstairs to your room.
    5) In the closet you should find a small baggy of weed.
    6) Combine this with the holed-out apple. This will create an apple bong.
    7) You can take the apple bong and while holding it, hold SHIFT. This will create a cloud of smoke,
    8) Your high level will now increase and you can stay sane in this suburban hellscape a little longer.
  
  You can also take the water bottle found in your mom's room, combine it with a pen found at her desk. This creates a water-bottle bong. This combined with the weed can be smoked in a similar manner to the apple bong described before. 
  
  Additionally, there is a can of fabreeze in the bathroom. Hold shift while holding this to spray around the space. 

DOCUMENTATION:
  Documentation of Suburban Teen Simulator's progress thus far can be found in the "Documentation" folder. 

DISCLAIMER
This is a complete work in progess. I ran into a huge road block when trying to create the mother character with her own behavior and patterns. I think I have to recreate this in Unity or something that's deeper than p5 to truly get it to where I want it to be. 

Ideally all of these things would add up create functional, fun gameplay, but this was made using p5 which I simply don't think can support something like that. There are simply too many things going on each frame to all be tracked simoultaneously.
That being said I am very proud of the crafting system and the art style. 

Enjoy :)
